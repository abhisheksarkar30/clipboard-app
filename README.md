## Introduction
While working on computer, we usually come acorss many monotonous tasks related to ***clipboard*** and sometimes feel if there was a tool which could perform the tasks silently once we copy something, and get the result reflected when we paste them somewhere, i.e. ***the magic happens between successive copy and paste operations***.

This tool serves you this very convenient but simple to use feature-set.

## Prerequisites
Java 7+

## Usage
Directly double-click on the ClipboardProcessingApp.jar file, if proper java.exe is set as default, else java -jar ClipboardProcessingApp.jar

## Supported Actions
 - Extraction of a list from copied value based on the delimiter.
 - Replace a part of each list item with another string.
 - Sort the items of the list by String/Number type in ascending/descending order.
 - Wrap each list item with starting/ending string token.
 - Reform a single sentence out of the list, with a new delimiter.
 - Wrap the entire single sentence with starting/ending string token.
 
## Notes to follow
As long as the tool is active, clipboard operations will be as per this tool, which remains in auto-play mode.
To stop the operations of the tool, please shutdown the tool properly, no java process should remain active for the same.
